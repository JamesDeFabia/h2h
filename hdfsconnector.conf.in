#HADOOP_SHARE_DIR = location of hadoop share files
#IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SET THIS VARIABLE CORRECTLY
#This is used to set up the classpath for libhdfs.
#
# per Hadoop: http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.3.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/LibHdfs.html
# One of the most common problems with libhdfs is the CLASSPATH is not set properly when calling a program that uses libhdfs.
# Make sure you set it to all the Hadoop jars needed to run Hadoop itself.
# Currently, there is no way to programmatically generate the classpath, but a good bet is to include all the jar files in
# $HADOOP_PREFIX and $HADOOP_PREFIX/lib as well as the right configuration directory containing hdfs-site.xml
# However as it turns out, the jars are in different subfolders under the share directory
#
# The share folder contains certain needed jar files such as:
# /hadoop/hdfs/hadoop-hdfs-2.3.0.jar, hadoop/common/hadoop-common-2.3.0.jar, etc
# NOTE: the contents of this path has changed in Hadoop's packaging strategy. Starting hadoop 2.x, the share folder only
# contains 32 bit binaries. And it is then, the user's responsibility to build all necessary libs/jars.
# This path is used by the h2h connector to build the necessary libhdfs classpath.
#Example: HADOOP_SHARE_DIR=${HADOOP_STD_SHARE_PATH}
HADOOP_SHARE_DIR=${HADOOP_STD_SHARE_PATH}

#H2H searches for libhdfs at this location:
# ${H2H_LIBHDFS_PATH}
#If libhdfs resides elsewhere, append correct location to H2H_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#Example:
#H2H_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$H2H_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path to libhdfs.so location>
H2H_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${H2H_LIBHDFS_PATH}

#TARBALL_HADOOP_LOCATION = location of tarball hadoop instalation
#If hadoop was not installed via deb/rpm install package
#enable this var.
#NOTE: starting in 2.x, Hadoop stopped distributing pre-built native libraries
#This value is most likely only useful for Hadoop distributions prior to 2.x
TARBALL_HADOOP_LOCATION=${TARBALLED_HADOOP_PATH}

#H2H default libjvm location:
# ${H2H_LIBJVM_PATH}
# If libjvm resides elsewhere, append correct location to H2H_LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#Example:
#H2H_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$H2H_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${H2H_LIBJVM_PATH}
H2H_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$H2H_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${H2H_LIBJVM_PATH}
